SelectPaginated is a React component that provides a dropdown with features like pagination, search, and both single and multi-select options. 
It can source data from both the client-side and an API. By fetching data in small chunks and using local storage to remember the fetched data, 
it efficiently handles large datasets. This approach keeps the dropdown fast and responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience.
